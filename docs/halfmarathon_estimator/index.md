# Halfmarathon Estimator App
2025-01-03

** Project description: **
The aim of the project was to create an application that would use a regression algorithm to train models and would be able to predict (based on previously trained data) the time in which a user would run a half marathon - by providing specific data.

** Project description: **
- allowing the user to enter data freely (without any appropriate conversion of the record) -> the LLM model used extracts data from the user into a JSON structure and prepares it for use by the regression model,
- simple functionality allows for the final estimation of the time to run a half marathon - using the trained best regression model,
- the LLM model is connected to Langfuse to track the model's life cycle.

- Python,
- PyCaret,

- Langfuse,
- OpenAI,
- Streamlit,
- Pandas,
