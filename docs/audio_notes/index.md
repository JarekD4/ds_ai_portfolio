# Audio Notes App

2024-11-30

** Project description: **
The goal of the project was to create the first AI-powered application. To do this, I used two LLM models from OpenAI: whisper-1 (speech -> text) and text-embeddings-3-large (text -> embeddings).

** Main functionalities: **
- recording and listening to voice notes,
- transcription of voices into text using AI,
- ability to collect notes in the QDrant database,
- semantic data search, using the text processing algorithm on embeddings and finding similarities based on Cosinus Similarity.

** Skills: **
- Python,
- QDrant,
- OpenAI embeddings,
- OpenAI whisper-1,
- Streamlit,
- Dotenv,
- PyDub,
- io,
- md5.

The application has been deployed on the Streamlit Community App and is available for public use.
