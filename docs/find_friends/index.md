2024-11-15

** Project description: **
The aim of the project was to create an application that would enable the use of a clustering model to match a user to the appropriate group from a loaded data set (data comes from an anonymized survey) - based on data provided by the user.

** Main functionalities: **
- the user filters basic data, such as: age, education, gender, favorite animals or favorite places - corresponding to their preferences,
- then the previously trained clustering model creates the appropriate number of clusters for the survey data and matches the user's preferences to the matching group,
- finally, using LLM, adequate cluster descriptions are generated.

** Skills: **
- Python,
- Langfuse,
- OpenAI,
- Streamlit,
- Scikit-learn,
- Plotly,
- PyCaret (Clustering),
- NumPy,
- Matplotlib.

The application has been deployed on the Streamlit Community App and is available for public use.
