# Features Detective

** 2024-12-05**

Project description:
The aim of the project was to create a universal application that allows for detecting the most important features in a given data set. In short - the user uploads data or loads a ready data set in the appropriate format, then selects automatic detection of the column they want to analyze or makes this selection themselves. Finally, they receive a generated graph of the significance of features that have the greatest impact on the previously selected column. The user also receives a clear description of the graph along with recommendations - what can be improved to, for example, improve the analyzed data.

Main functionalities:
- the user can load a CSV/JSON file with data or use a ready-made sample dataset,
- the user indicates the target column -> additionally, they can use automatic column detection (generated by LLM),
- the application automatically recognizes whether the loaded data is related to the regression or classification problem and selects the appropriate AI model training algorithm on this basis,
- based on the trained model, a chart containing the most important features is displayed,
- finally, the user receives a clear description of the chart along with recommendations - what actions to implement to improve the results related to the analyzed target data column.
