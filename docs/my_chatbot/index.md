- you can choose between various models from OpenAI (more models in the future),
- the costs of using AI are counted,
- you can give the chatbot individual awareness that will guide the types of answers to the questions asked.

** Skills: **

The application has been deployed on the Streamlit Community App helps me explore the secrets of AI and expand my programming skills on a daily basis.
