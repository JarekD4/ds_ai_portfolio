In short - the user uploads data or loads a ready data set in the appropriate format, then selects automatic detection of the column they want to analyze or makes this selection themselves. Finally, they receive a generated graph of the significance of features that have the greatest impact on the previously selected column. The user also receives a clear description of the graph along with recommendations - what can be improved to, for example, improve the analyzed data.</p> <p>Main functionalities: - the user can load a CSV/JSON file with data or use a ready-made sample dataset, - the user indicates the target column -&gt; additionally, they can use automatic column detection (generated by LLM), - the application automatically recognizes whether the loaded data is related to the regression or classification problem and selects the appropriate AI model training algorithm on this basis, - based on the trained model, a chart containing the most important features is displayed, - finally, the user receives a clear description of the chart along with recommendations - what actions to implement to improve the results related to the analyzed target data column.</p> <p>Skills: - Python, - Langfuse, - OpenAI, - Streamlit, - PyCaret (Classification &amp; Regression), - Pandas, - Matplotlib, - Instructor, - Pydantic, - Boto3.</p> <p>The application has been deployed on the Streamlit Community App and is available for public use.</p> <p>Link do repository: https://github.com/JarekD4/wykrywacz_cech Link do app: https://wykrywaczcech-jd.streamlit.app/</p> <p>Pobierz Notebook</p>"},{"location":"find_friends/","title":"Find Friends App","text":"<p>2024-11-15</p> <p> Project description:  The aim of the project was to create an application that would enable the use of a clustering model to match a user to the appropriate group from a loaded data set (data comes from an anonymized survey) - based on data provided by the user.</p> <p> Main functionalities:  - the user filters basic data, such as: age, education, gender, favorite animals or favorite places - corresponding to their preferences, - then the previously trained clustering model creates the appropriate number of clusters for the survey data and matches the user's preferences to the matching group, - finally, using LLM, adequate cluster descriptions are generated.</p> <p> Skills:  - Python, - Langfuse, - OpenAI, - Streamlit, - Scikit-learn, - Plotly, - PyCaret (Clustering), - NumPy, - Matplotlib.</p> <p>The application has been deployed on the Streamlit Community App and is available for public use.</p> <p>Link do repository: https://github.com/JarekD4/ankieta_powitalna</p>"},{"location":"halfmarathon_estimator/","title":"Halfmarathon Estimator App","text":"<p>2025-01-03</p> <p> Project description:  The aim of the project was to create an application that would use a regression algorithm to train models and would be able to predict (based on previously trained data) the time in which a user would run a half marathon - by providing specific data.</p> <p> Project description:  - allowing the user to enter data freely (without any appropriate conversion of the record) -&gt; the LLM model used extracts data from the user into a JSON structure and prepares it for use by the regression model, - simple functionality allows for the final estimation of the time to run a half marathon - using the trained best regression model, - the LLM model is connected to Langfuse to track the model's life cycle.</p> <p> Skills:  - Python, - PyCaret, - Machine Learning, - Langfuse, - OpenAI, - Streamlit, - Pandas, - Instructor, - Pydantic, - Langfuse, - Dotenv.</p>"},{"location":"iris/","title":"Domain exploration (EDA) of the dataset: Irisesa","text":"<p>2024-10-01</p> <p> Introduction:  I invite you to familiarize yourself with my project, which takes us into the world of data analysis on Irises - using domain exploration (EDA).
